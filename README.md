This is an image repository app built for merchants to update their inventory using Javascript and React on the front-end with a Ruby on Rails API back-end. The user uploads a product image, inputs a short description and a price for the product, and clicks submit to post their product. Product prices can be updated to reflect discounts or lower prices. Once a product is purchased, the merchant can remove the product from their listing.

Note: Images are uploaded using Cloudinary - a third-party cloud-based image and video management platform.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have ruby-2.6.3 and Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or a later version installed.

Familiarize yourself with the following documentation and source code:

- Ruby on Rails Guides
- React Docs
- React Source Code

Important:  
If you donâ€™t already have one, please register for a free Cloudinary account here: https://cloudinary.com/. Once you sign up, your credentials/account details (including Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret) will be integrated into the Rails API. These can be found on the top left-hand corner of your dashboard.

Under config/initializers, create a new file named cloudinary.rb. In this file, replace values with your newly obtained Cloudinary credentials wrapped in a string.
```
Cloudinary.config do |config|
  config.cloud_name = "cloud_name"
  config.api_key = "api_key"
  config.api_secret = "api_secret"
  config.secure = true
  config.cdn_subdomain = true
end
```
